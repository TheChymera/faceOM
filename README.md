Python and MATLAB scripts for data processing and analysis written for the [“Neuronal Correlates of Occulometric Parameters in Face Recognition”](https://github.com/TheChymera/masterarbeit) research project.
We would like to give thanks to the clinical psychology department around Prof. Peter Kirsch (at the Central institute of Mental Health in Mannheim) for providing  drafts and support for the MATLAB scripts.
